# Python
My python learning adventures

My goal is to learn python for automation and infosec purposes, I will be starting by following automate the boring stuff from no starch press, then I will move on to whatever random projects come to mind.

If you see something useful to you here you are free to take it, but keep in mind that everything in this repo will likely be riddled with bugs, so, do so at your own risk.
